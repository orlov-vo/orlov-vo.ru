    <p>
        Main hobby for me is a developing applications for humans. Also I have favourite activities
        that arenâ€™t connected with computers. I like snowboarding and swimming, but also I like
        passive activities as relaxing on a beach or going to picnic. I love travelling and
        exploring something.

        I've been jumping from the sky (above 4000 meters) with my wife, after that I think I don't
        scared by difficulties.
